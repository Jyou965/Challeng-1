# Loan Portfolio Assessment Application

This is an application for loan portfolio assessment written in python.  It summarizes the average loan amount for the portfolio, determines whether a loan is worth the cost based on required hurdle rate, calculates the present value of a loan and selects loans whose face values are below the threshold.  It prints the selected list of loans and also compiles the list into a separate csv file.
